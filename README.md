# Manhattan
This is our group's project website! 

## Introduction
This website explores basic information about the clean heat systems of Greenwich Willage, Kips Bay, Hell's Kitchen, the Upper East Side, and Soho! Each website includes basic demographics, a brief description of the NYS Clean Heat program, the data emissions of Manhattan, and an analysis of the data.

## Borrough Overview
We chose to explore Greenwich Village, the Upper East Side, Hell's Kitchen, Kips Bay, and Soho's demographics for a basic understanding of the area. We also had to research the way that different clean heat programs from New York would impact the way that we perceived the data. Some of these programs included the DEP Boiler Registration Program and the Clean Heat Program. We also needed to explore the greenhouse emissions of NYC and possibly explore the intricacies of how Manhattan as a borrough would contribute to the emissions.
